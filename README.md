# easy_videl_player

A video player widget displayed using the GSYVideoPlayer player (VideoView in Android and AVPlayer in iOS).


## Installation
Due to numerous events, it has not yet been published on pub.dev.
First you need to add the dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
easy_videl_player: 
    git:
      url: https://github.com/ZhouC125/easy_video_player.git
```

Then import the plugin in the .dart file you want to use it.

```dart
import 'package:easy_video_player/easy_video_player.dart';
```


```dart
const SizedBox(
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  child: VideoPlayerWidget(url: ''); 
);
```
To be improved..
